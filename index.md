A blog about my projects and somewhere to display what I make 
---

A play on Descartes' "Cogito, ergo sum" or "I think, therefore I am", "Cogito, ergo facio" or "I think, therefore I make" perfectly encapsulates my drive as a maker.
Ask anyone about what I'm up to and you'll get a plethora of different projects that I've mentioned working on. 

This blog serves to *hopefully* keep track of them and show my builds to the world
