First things first, I'm new to using Jekyll as a static site generator so there's a chance the formatting looks weird overall. 
### The first iteration vs the final iteration side by side

## A Project In Retrospect

Over the next few weeks I'm going to be retroactively documenting the first major project I've worked on since college. This post is going to serve as almost a forward to those posts to get some background info and inspirations out of the way.

Overall this project took a little over a year to finish with my final change coming the week before OpenSauce (07/19/2025). The earliest documented reference that I could find was a sketch in a notebook circa 03/06/2024. I think the largest timesink of all was waiting for PCB iterations to be shipped overseas whenever I made hardware iterations. 

## Inspiration

If you're reading this there's a good chance I told you the story of how I came up with the idea for this business card.  However for those who havent, back in 2022 when I was doing my internship in Chicago I had the chance to go to an Intern meet and greet for all of the interns who were there for the summer.  During the meet and greet I was talking with an intern at an architectural firm and he handed me a piece of laser cut acrylic with his personal information etched into it.  
Entranced by its novelty I ended up keeping that business card for the next two years as I could never bring myself to throw it out.  After graduating college while looking for jobs I struggled searching for something that I had that would stand out against the crowd of entry level developers.  I found that acrylic business card again and thought about how it unintentionally became meaningfull since it was made out of more than just paper.  As all sane projects start I thought "what the logical extreme that I could take this to"

## Features

- Plays Tetris
- Includes personal/contact information
- Reprogrammable (Easy to modify and create more games for it)

## Considerations

There were 3 major things I was focused on while designing this:
- Form factor
    - In the same vain as cost, this mostly comes down to part choice. How thin is the battery I'm using, how tall are the buttons, etc.
- Cost
    - I'm not made of money, I'd need to choose the best parts for my use case and optimize for larger scale production
- Cool Factor / Wow Factor
    - Self explanatory, its gotta make whoever I hand it to say "Wow" or "Thats cool" 

while not a main consideration I wanted to make something that people could also use outside of what I designed it for (eg. playing tetris).

## Points Of Learning

There were a bunch of new skill that I aquired during this project such as:
- PCB Design and Part Choice
- PCB Manufacturing 
- Low Level Coding for MCU's

While a very high level overview I already have designed a whole other project based off of what I started learning with this. 

>*(hint: its Dungeons and Dragons Related)*

## Final thoughts for this post
I'm excited to share more related to this and my other projects. Hopefully I can find a good way of embedding a video so I can show the business card in action
